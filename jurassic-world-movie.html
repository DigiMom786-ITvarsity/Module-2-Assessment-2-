                    <P>Five years after the events of Jurassic World Dominion, the planet’s ecology has proven largely inhospitable to dinosaurs.
                      Those remaining exist in isolated equatorial environments with climates resembling the one in which they once thrived. 
                      The three most colossal creatures across land, sea and air within that tropical biosphere hold, in their DNA, the key to
                      a drug that will bring miraculous life-saving benefits to humankind.Academy Award® nominee Johansson plays skilled covert 
                      operations expert Zora Bennett, contracted to lead a skilled team on a top-secret mission to secure the genetic material.
                      When Zora’s operation intersects with a civilian family whose boating expedition was capsized by marauding aquatic dinos, 
                      they all find themselves stranded on a forbidden island that had once housed an undisclosed research facility for Jurassic
                      Park. There, in a terrain populated by dinosaurs of vastly different species, they come face-to-face with a sinister, 
                      shocking discovery that has been hidden from the world for decades. Ali is Duncan Kincaid, Zora’s most trusted team member;
                      Critics Choice and Olivier Award winner Jonathan Bailey plays paleontologist Dr. Henry Loomis; 
                      Emmy nominee Rupert Friend appears as Big Pharma representative Martin Krebs and 
                      Manuel Garcia-Rulfo plays Reuben Delgado, the father of the shipwrecked
                      civilian family. The cast includes Luna Blaise, David Iacono and Audrina Miranda
                      as Reuben’s family. The film also features, as members of Zora and Krebs’ crews, Philippine Velge,
                      Bechir Sylvain and Ed Skrein.
